## How to run

1. Clone `$ git clone <url of repo>` or download the project to your computer.
2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
3. Open `localhost:8000` (or or another which you chose) in your browser.
